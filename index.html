    <h2>The Tates</h2>

    <p>
        The Tates inclues Emory Tate, the father, and his 2 sons, Andrew and Tristan Tate. 
        They are all known for their strong masculinity and their ways of keeping their masculine side, and spreading it to young teenagers. 
        Personally, they are my biggest influencers.
